# DeFiHub: Decentralized Finance Protocol

DeFiHub is a comprehensive decentralized finance protocol that combines governance, liquidity provision, and token streaming into a unified ecosystem. The protocol is designed to provide essential financial services with a focus on simplicity, efficiency, and user experience.

## Protocol Overview

DeFiHub empowers users to participate in decentralized finance through three core pillars: governance participation, liquidity provision, and structured token distribution. Our protocol creates sustainable value for all participants while maintaining security and transparency.

## Core Components

### 1. GovernanceToken & GroupStaking

**File**: `src/GovernanceToken.sol`

The governance system enables token holders to participate in protocol decision-making and optimize rewards through collective staking mechanisms.

**GovernanceToken Features:**
- ERC20-compliant governance token with standard functionality
- Advanced user status management for protocol security
- Controlled token distribution through minting mechanisms
- Enhanced security with transfer restrictions for flagged accounts

**GroupStaking Features:**
- Collective staking pools for optimized gas efficiency
- Proportional reward distribution based on configurable weights
- Flexible member weights (must sum to 100% for balanced distribution)
- Collaborative fund management reducing individual overhead

**Technical Specifications:**
- Token Name: "DeFiHub Governance" (DFHG)
- Initial Supply: 1,000,000 tokens
- Decimals: 18 (standard ERC20)
- Staking Group Size: Unlimited members per group
- Weight Distribution: Fully customizable, automatically validated

### 2. LiquidityPool & PoolShare

**File**: `src/LiquidityPool.sol`

The LiquidityPool serves as the protocol's primary value accrual mechanism, enabling users to provide ETH liquidity and earn proportional rewards through an innovative share-based system.

**LiquidityPool Features:**
- ETH deposits with automatic share-based ownership tracking
- Time-locked withdrawals ensuring protocol stability and preventing flash loan attacks
- Cryptographic signature-based reward claiming for enhanced security
- Proxy deposit functionality enabling institutional and third-party integrations
- Sustainable fee collection mechanism (10% of rewards) for protocol development

**PoolShare Features:**
- ERC20-compliant share tokens representing proportional pool ownership
- Burnable token mechanism for efficient withdrawal processing
- Owner-controlled minting ensuring proper share accounting

**Technical Specifications:**
- Share Token Name: "Liquidity Pool Share" (LPS)
- Reward Rate: 10% of deposit value distributed over time
- Withdrawal Delay: 24-hour security delay for large withdrawals
- Fee Structure: 10% of rewards allocated to protocol treasury

### 3. StableCoin & TokenStreamer

**File**: `src/StableCoin.sol`

Our native stablecoin provides price stability and serves as the backbone for the protocol's token streaming infrastructure, enabling sophisticated distribution mechanisms.

**StableCoin Features:**
- ERC20-compliant stablecoin with optimized decimal structure
- Unrestricted minting system allowing flexible token supply management
- Gas-optimized design with 1 decimal place for reduced transaction costs
- Seamless integration with all protocol components
- **Security Note**: Minting function is public and unrestricted - suitable for testing environments

**TokenStreamer Features:**
- Continuous time-based token distribution for vesting and rewards
- Flexible streaming durations (1 hour to 1 year) customizable per stream
- Linear release mechanism ensuring predictable token flow
- Multi-stream support per user enabling complex distribution schemes
- Additional deposit capability via `addToStream()` to extend existing streams
- Comprehensive stream querying and monitoring functions
- **Design Choice**: Stream end times remain fixed; additional deposits increase token amounts without extending duration
- **Design Choice**: Streams cannot be canceled once initiated - tokens must be withdrawn as they become available

**Technical Specifications:**
- Token Name: "USD Stable" (USDS)
- Decimal Places: 1 (gas-optimized for frequent transactions)
- Initial Supply: 1,000,000 tokens
- Stream Duration: Flexible (minimum 1 hour, maximum 1 year)
- Distribution Model: Linear time-based release with precise calculations
- Stream Management: Multiple concurrent streams per user supported

### 4. StakeToken & ValidatorStaking

**File**: `src/StakeToken.sol`

ValidatorStaking introduces a validator-focused staking market where participants lock STK, accrue rewards, and can be slashed for protocol offenses.

**StakeToken Features:**
- ERC20 stake asset dedicated to validator collateralization
- Owner-controlled minting for deterministic test setup
- Standard 18-decimal accounting for stake and rewards

**ValidatorStaking Features:**
- Permissionless validator enrollment with minimum stake threshold enforcement
- Dedicated `slasher` role for offense processing, separate from owner account
- Configurable offense penalties with treasury-directed slash settlement
- Two-step unstaking flow (`requestUnstake` -> `completeUnstake`) with 7-day unbonding period
- Owner-funded reward pool distributed pro-rata via cumulative `rewardPerTokenStored`

**Roles and Responsibilities:**
- **Owner**: Sets slasher, treasury, offense penalties, and funds reward pool
- **Slasher**: Marks disputes and executes `slash()` on malicious validators
- **Validator**: Stakes tokens, requests unstake, completes unbonding withdrawals, claims rewards

**Offenses and Default Penalties:**
- `DoubleSigning`: 50% slash
- `Downtime`: 10% slash
- `Misconduct`: 100% slash

**Slashing Math:**
- Exposed balance = `stakedAmount + unbondingAmount`
- Slash amount = `exposed * slashPercentBps[offense] / 10_000`
- Slashed funds transfer directly to protocol treasury

**Reward Math:**
- Funding updates accumulator: `rewardPerTokenStored += rewardAmount * REWARD_PRECISION / totalStaked`
- Per-validator accrual: `pending = stakedAmount * rewardPerTokenStored / REWARD_PRECISION - rewardDebt`
- Claim transfers accrued amount from pool reserves to validator

## User Flows

### Governance Participation Flow

1. **Token Acquisition**: Users acquire DFHG tokens through ecosystem participation or approved distribution channels
2. **Group Formation**: Create or join staking groups with like-minded participants
3. **Collective Staking**: Pool tokens with group members to optimize gas costs and maximize rewards
4. **Reward Distribution**: Automatically receive proportional rewards based on group weight configuration
5. **Governance Voting**: Participate in protocol decisions using accumulated governance power

### Liquidity Provider Flow

1. **Initial Deposit**: Deposit ETH into the LiquidityPool using `deposit()` function
2. **Share Receipt**: Automatically receive LPS tokens representing proportional pool ownership
3. **Reward Accrual**: Earn continuous rewards based on deposit size and duration
4. **Reward Claiming**: Use cryptographic signatures to securely claim accrued rewards via `claimReward()`
5. **Strategic Withdrawal**: Withdraw liquidity after security time lock using `withdraw()`

### Token Streaming Flow

1. **Stream Setup**: Approve USDS spending allowance for the TokenStreamer contract
2. **Stream Creation**: Create streams using `createStream(recipient, amount, duration)` with custom durations
3. **Stream Enhancement**: Add additional tokens to existing streams using `addToStream(streamId, amount)`
4. **Continuous Release**: Tokens automatically become available over the specified streaming period
5. **Recipient Withdrawal**: Recipients withdraw available tokens using `withdrawFromStream(streamId)` as they vest
6. **Stream Monitoring**: Query stream information using `getStreamInfo()`, `getUserStreams()`, and `getAvailableTokens()`
7. **Stream Management**: Monitor and manage multiple concurrent streams for complex distribution schemes

## Security Features

DeFiHub implements multiple layers of security to protect user funds and maintain protocol integrity:

### Access Control
- **Owner-based governance**: All contracts use OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` pattern where the admin/owner is a trusted entity with privileged access
- **GovernanceToken owner** can mint new tokens and blacklist/whitelist user accounts to prevent malicious actors
- **GroupStaking owner** can withdraw and distribute tokens from staking groups as the group owner
- **LiquidityPool owner** receives protocol fees from reward claims and controls the PoolShare token minting
- **User blacklisting**: The GovernanceToken contract allows the owner to blacklist addresses, preventing them from transferring tokens

### Economic Security
- **Time-locked withdrawals**: 24-hour withdrawal delay in LiquidityPool preventing flash loan exploitation
- **Proportional reward distribution**: GroupStaking distributes rewards according to predefined weights ensuring fair value accrual
- **Protocol fees**: 10% fee mechanism on LiquidityPool reward claims supporting long-term protocol sustainability

### Technical Security
- **Signature-based authentication**: ECDSA signature verification for LiquidityPool reward claims with nonce-based replay protection
- **Overflow protection**: All mathematical operations use Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection
- **Comprehensive event logging**: All contracts emit detailed events for transparency and monitoring

**Note**: The protocol relies on trusted administrators (contract owners) for critical operations. Users should verify the trustworthiness of these actors before participating.
